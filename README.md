Here’s a detailed **README** file outlining the step-by-step procedure for installing dependencies, setting up the environment, and running the project in any IDE like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or VS Code:

# **README: Data Science Assignment Implementation**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing eCommerce transactions, deriving insights, building a lookalike model, and performing customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and execute the project.

---

## **Step 1: Installation and Setup**

### **1.1 Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### **1.2 Install Required Libraries**
Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Alternatively, if you're using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, install the libraries directly in the notebook:

```python
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### **1.3 Download and Prepare the Data**
- Download the three `.csv` files: `Customers.csv`, `Products.csv`, and `Transactions.csv` (links provided in the assignment).
- Place all the `.csv` files in the same directory as your project file or upload them to your Colab notebook.

---

## **Step 2: Running the Project**

### **2.1 Running in Jupyter Notebook**
1. Open your terminal or command prompt and type:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory where your `.ipynb` file is located and open it.
3. Ensure that all `.csv` files are in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Run the cells step by step to execute the code.

### **2.2 Running in Google Colab**
1. Upload your `.ipynb` file to Google Colab.
2. Upload the `.csv` files by clicking on the "Files" tab and using the upload option.
3. Ensure file paths match the uploaded files.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

### **2.3 Running in VS Code**
1. Install the **Python extension** for VS Code.
2. Open the `.py` file or the `.ipynb` file in VS Code.
3. Place the `.csv` files in the same directory as your script.
4. Open a terminal in VS Code and execute the file:
   ```bash
   python <filename.py>
   ```

## **Step 3: Steps to Execute Code**

### **3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Load the datasets using `pandas` and perform basic data cleaning (handle missing values, duplicates, etc.).
- Perform visualizations to derive key business insights.
- Save the insights in a PDF for submission.

### **3.2 Lookalike Model**
- Use the customer and transaction data to create a profile for each customer.
- Calculate similarity scores and recommend top 3 similar customers for the first 20.
- Save the results to `Lookalike.csv`.

### **3.3 Clustering for Customer Segmentation**
- Scale the features and use clustering techniques like K-means.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and DB Index.
- Visualize and evaluate the clusters.
- Save the results and clustering summary in a PDF and CSV file.

## **Step 4: File Structure**

Here’s the expected file structure for the project:

```
Project/
├── Customers.csv
├── Products.csv
├── Transactions.csv
├── EDA.ipynb
├── Lookalike.ipynb
├── Clustering.ipynb
├── Lookalike.csv
├── Customer_Clusters.csv
├── Cluster_Summary.csv
└── README.md
```

---

## **Step 5: Outputs**
After running the project, ensure the following files are generated for submission:
1. **EDA.pdf** – Contains business insights derived from the analysis.
2. **Lookalike.csv** – Contains top 3 similar customers for each of the first 20.
3. **Clustering.pdf** – Contains clustering results, DB Index, and visualizations.
4. **Clustering.ipynb** – Notebook for clustering code.

---

## **Tips**
- Use `print()` statements to debug any issues.
- Always check the file paths when uploading or running in a different IDE.
- Ensure the libraries are installed correctly before starting.
